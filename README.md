# Unsupervised Machine Learning Project to Identify Customers Segments

This goal for this project is to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company using unsupervised machine learning. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns.

This project was done as part of the Udacity Nanodegree : Introduction to Machine Learning with Tensorflow Nanodegree during the final model on Unsupervised Learning. 

Those are the steps that were done to realise this project: 
### 1. Load the Data 
### 2. Preprocessing 




      2.1 Assess Missing Data
      2.2 Select and Re-encode Features
      2.3 Create a Cleaning Function

### 3. Feature Transformation 




     3.1 Apply Feature Scaling
     3.2 Perform Dimensionality Reduction
     3.3 Interpret Principal Components

### 4. Clustering




    4.1 Apply clustering to General Population
    4.2 Apply All Steps to the Customer Data 
    4.3 Compare Customer Data to Demographics Data
