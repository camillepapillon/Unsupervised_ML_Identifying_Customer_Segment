# Unsupervised_ML_Identifying_Customer_Segment

This project is to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company . These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences 
that will have the highest expected rate of returns.

This project was done as part of the Udacity Nanodegree : Introduction to Machine Learning with Tensorflow Nanodegree during the final model on Unsupervised Learning.
